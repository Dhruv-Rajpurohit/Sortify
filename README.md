# Sortify


Built a sorting script in python to simply pass the path of the folder you want to sort files in, which separates documents, audio files, and video files automatically and makes separate folders for them respectively and make our directory clutter-free. Learned OS concepts in much larger spectrum to implement this project.

Programming Language used: Python
